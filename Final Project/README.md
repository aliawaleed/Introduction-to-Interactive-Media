**Final Project**

For my final project, I was inspired by a game I loved playing as a child.

The game is called [Feeding Frenzy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlcUbZO8pAM), and below is a screenshot of the game:

The goal of the game is to eat the most number of smaller fish and gain more points as well as and avoid being eaten by the bigger fish. 

- The more fish you eat, the bigger you get 
- When you get bigger, you get the ability to eat bigger fish 
- Bigger fish give you more points than smaller fish 
- You lose if you hit a bigger fish
