**Here is the description of my hands free switch**

For this assignment, I made a switch controlled by something I would do in my typical week; doing bicep curls with dumbbells. The idea seemed very interesting for me as I believe that it could be a way of both saving and producing power or electricity. Not only that, but it would also allow the user to push themselves such that they carry the dumbbell all the way to reach the satisfaction of the light bulb lighting up.

What I did is that I cut two longer pieces of a wire to make sure that I will be able to control it and move my arm freely. I then connected one side of each wire in series with the LED bulb and the resistor, such that when they touch, they close the circuit.

Accordingly, I got two pieces of foil to increase the surface area of contact between both wires as foil conducts electricity. I then stuck the loose end of both wire to a piece of foil that I then taped to my arm as shown below. 

I had trouble figuring out how I will be able to tape the foil on my arm in a way such that it both sticks to my arm and does not fall off, as well as trying to avoid covering the whole piece of foil so that the pieces of foil touch, seeing that tape does not conduct electricity, and hence would not allow the electrons to pass through.
